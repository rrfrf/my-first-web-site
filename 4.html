<h3>Society makes everything?!</h3> 
<p><strong>What comes in mind if I ask you how or what makes a <u>good student?</u></strong>
You might say being ot late in school, submitting your tasks on time and more.
<strong>But that might be <u>wrong.</u></strong></p>
<p>To start, this is what you think how a good student looks like.</p>
<img src="good student.jpg" width="400"><p style="margin-top:60px;"></p><p>But actually good students might be not studying and just playing, not finishing his or her tasks.
 But how? someone might ask, but before you ask that question what do you really think what or who makes you a good student.</p>\
